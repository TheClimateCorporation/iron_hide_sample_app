This is a very basic demonstration of IronHide using [Plain Old Ruby Objects](http://blog.jayfields.com/2007/10/ruby-poro.html) and authorization rules defined in a JSON flat file.

Now includes (recorded) specs for the [CouchDB Storage Adapter](https://github.com/TheClimateCorporation/iron_hide-storage-couchdb_adapter)

To test it out:

```
$ bundle install

# Run the tests
$ bundle exec rake
```
